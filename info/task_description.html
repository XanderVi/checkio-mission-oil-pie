    Sophia has cooked a pie made from oil for her drones and left it in the kitchen.
    The Drones were returning home in small groups or one by one, and haven’t been seeing each other upon their return,
    so each group had no idea how many drones has eaten their slice of the pie.
    Some groups know how big the pie was after Sophia removed it from the oven,
    but other groups don't know this and think the remaining part is the entire pie,
    and take their portion from the remaining.
    So each group has divided (mentally) the remaining part or initial pie and took their slice.
    How many parts will remain after all of the drones return?
</p>

<p>
    Let’s take a look at an example of how this should work:
    There are 6 drones. The first group consists of 2 drones.
    They has divided the pie into 6 parts and took 2/6 of the pie.
    The remainder of the pie is 2/3 of the entire pie.
    Next returns a single drone, it doesn’t know about the original size of the pie,
    so it divides the remaining pie into 6 slices and takes 1 part.
    This leaves 10/18=5/9. The last group consists of 3 drones,
    who’ve heard about the original size of the pie from Sophia.
    They took half of the original pie, so the remaining is 5/9&nbsp;-&nbsp;3/6&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/18
</p>
<p>
    You are given an ordered array with the group sizes in the order of their arrival.
    If a group knows about the initial pie size, then the size is positive.
    If not, then size will be negative. The recent example will given as (2,&nbsp;-1,&nbsp;3).

</p>

<p>
    You should calculate the size of the remaining pie as a fraction from the start size.
    The result should be represented as two numbers - numerator and denominator.
    Zero should be represented as (0, 1).
</p>



<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> The group sizes as a tuple of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The remaining pie as a list or tuple of two integers.
